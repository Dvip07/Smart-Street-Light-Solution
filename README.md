# Smart Street Light

## Description

The Smart Street Light project utilizes Arduino technology to create an intelligent street lighting system. The system is designed to optimize energy usage by adjusting the brightness of street lights based on external factors such as ambient light levels or motion detection. This README provides instructions for setting up the Arduino IDE and working with the project code.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Arduino IDE installed on your computer.

## Arduino IDE Installation

### 1. Download Arduino IDE

Download the Arduino IDE from the official website: [Arduino Software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

### 2. Install Arduino IDE

Follow the installation instructions provided on the Arduino website for your specific operating system.

## Working with the Code

### 1. Open Arduino IDE

Launch the Arduino IDE on your computer.

### 2. Open the Project Code

- Open the Arduino sketch (`.ino` file) for the Smart Street Light project.
- Review the code and comments to understand the functionality.

### 3. Connect Arduino Board

Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.

### 4. Configure Arduino IDE

- Select the correct board type and port from the "Tools" menu in the Arduino IDE.
- Ensure the proper board and port are selected for your specific Arduino model.

### 5. Upload Code to Arduino Board

- Click the "Upload" button in the Arduino IDE to compile and upload the code to the Arduino board.

### 6. Monitor Serial Output (if applicable)

If the code includes Serial.print statements for debugging or monitoring, open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to view output messages.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the code according to your project requirements. Adjust parameters, add features, or integrate additional sensors based on your needs.
